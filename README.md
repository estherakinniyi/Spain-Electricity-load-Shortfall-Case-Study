# Spain-Electricity-load-Shortfall-Case-Study

## Context:
The Spanish Government is contemplating increased investments in renewable energy. In pursuit of this, they require insights into Spain's existing trends and patterns in renewable and non-renewable energy generation. Specifically, they aim to predict daily load shortfalls under specific conditions (such as wind speed, pressure, humidity, etc.). Load shortfall represents the disparity between renewable and non-renewable energy generation.

## Expected Outcomes:

- Identify Energy Generation Trends: Analyze energy generation trends and patterns.
- Regression Model: Develop a regression model for predicting load shortfalls.
- Presentation: Present findings to inform decision-making.
  
## Tools Used:

- Programming Language: Python
- Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-Learn (SKLearn), Pandas, NumPy
- Web Framework: Flask
- Cloud Infrastructure: AWS EC2
  
## Outputs:

- We achieved an ensemble model with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 3582, ranking 6th out of 38 teams. This indicates our ability to accurately predict load shortfalls.

- Histogram: The histogram illustrates predominantly positive load shortfalls, suggesting that renewable energy generation often exceeds non-renewable energy generation.

- Weekend Load Shortfall: The line graph shows lower load shortfalls during weekends, potentially due to reduced power consumption.

- Seasonal Load Shortfall: The line graph reveals higher load shortfalls during summer months, likely attributable to increased solar generation.

## Recommendations:

- Investigate Weekend Load Shortfall: Further investigation is warranted to understand why load shortfalls are lower on weekends.

- If the lower shortfall is due to reduced power consumption, the Spanish government should prioritize power generation on weekdays (when demand is higher).
- Alternatively, if the lower shortfall is due to other factors, it may be beneficial to enhance weekend power generation to increase renewable energy utilization.
- Diversify Seasonal Priorities: Given the substantial renewable electricity production during summer, explore prioritizing other seasons.
- Consider energy sources that perform well in non-summer seasons, such as wind energy.
